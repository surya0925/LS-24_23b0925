IN ASSIGNMENT 2 Folder :
There is no folder of node_modules because of files size limit,Sorry ...
I added videos runing in mobile version,firefox desktop version.
Highlights:
  U can edit,delete,save,a note.
  When edited or saved it is saved in a order i.e Last edited or saved is at last.
  Edit,Save,Delete Buttons are created using Bootstrap.
  U can Toggle between Light and Dark Mode on the top right Icon.
  For Saving a Note u should follow these conditions :
    1. Title should not be more than 50 characters long.
    2. Similarly Content below it should not be more than 200 characters long.
    3. Title and Content should not be empty (Spaces does not work too).
  Date is added to keep a note when saved when using for long time frame it is useful.
The above Highlights are for mobile version too.

    <h1>Plot</h1>
    <img src ="charcters.jpg" id ="characters">
    <h4>In 2004, Michael Townley, Trevor Philips, and Brad Snider partake in a failed robbery in Ludendorff, North Yankton, resulting <br>
        in Michael being presumed dead. Nine years later, Michael lives with his family in the city of Los Santos under the alias<br> 
        Michael De Santa, having made a secret agreement with the Federal Investigation Bureau (FIB) agent Dave Norton to stay <br>
        hidden. Across town, gangbanger Franklin Clinton works for a corrupt car salesman and meets Michael while attempting to <br> 
        fraudulently repossess his son's car. The two later become friends. When Michael finds his wife sleeping with her tennis coach,<br>
        he and Franklin chase the coach to a mansion, which Michael heavily damages in anger. The owner of the mansion, drug lord <br>
        Martin Madrazo, demands compensation. Michael returns to a life of crime to obtain the money, and enlists Franklin as an accomplice.<br>
        With the help of Michael's old friend Lester Crest, a disabled hacker, they rob a jewellery store to pay off the debt.<br>
        Meanwhile, Trevor, who lives in squalor in rural Blaine County, hears of the heist and realises it was Michael's work; Trevor<br>
        had believed the FIB killed Michael in the Ludendorff heist. Trevor finds Michael and reunites with him, forcing Michael <br>
         to reluctantly accept him back into his life.</h4>
    <img src = "lamar.jpg" id ="lamar">
    <h4>
        As time goes on, the protagonists' lives spiral out of control. Michael's criminal behaviour prompts his family to leave him.<br>
         When he later becomes a movie producer, he comes into conflict with Devin Weston, a billionaire venture capitalist and corporate raider,<br>
        who attempts to shut down Michael's studio. Michael thwarts his efforts and inadvertently kills his lawyer, causing Devin to vow revenge. <br>
        Meanwhile, Franklin rescued his friend Lamar Davis from their former friend and rival gangbanger Harold "Stretch" Joseph, who attempts to kill them.<br>
        Concurrently, Trevor tries to consolidate his control over various black markets in Blaine County, waging war against The Lost outlaw motorcycle club, <br>
        Latino street gangs, rival meth dealers, the private military company Merryweather, and triad kingpin Wei Cheng.

    <h4>
        Having broken his agreement with Dave by committing robberies again, Michael is coerced by Dave and his superior, Steve <br>
        Haines, to perform a series of operations alongside Franklin and Trevor to undermine the International Affairs Agency (IAA).<br>
        Under Steve's direction and with Lester's help, they attack an armored car carrying funds for the IAA and steal an <br>
        experimental nerve agent from an IAA lab. As Steve comes under increasing scrutiny, he forces Michael and Franklin to erase evidence <br>
        against him from the FIB servers. Michael takes the opportunity to wipe the data on his activities, destroying Steve's leverage over him.

    <h4>
        After reconciling with his family, Michael starts planning his final heist with Trevor, Franklin, and Lester: raiding the Union Depository's <br>
        gold bullion reserve. However, Trevor discovers that Brad was not imprisoned as he was led to believe, but killed during the Ludendorff heist <br>
        and buried in the grave marked for Michael. Deducing that the heist was a setup and that he was supposed to be killed in Brad's place, <br>
        Trevor feels betrayed and leaves Michael for dead following a shootout with Cheng's henchmen. Although Franklin rescues Michael, Trevor's<br>
         anger towards the latter causes friction within the group and threatens to undermine their plans. Meanwhile, Steve attempts to arrest Michael and Dave,<br>
        and they become caught in a Mexican standoff between the FIB, the IAA, and Merryweather. Steve escapes while Michael and Dave are rescued by Trevor, <br>
        who believes only he has the right to kill Michael.
    </h4>
    <img src = "options.jpeg" id = "options">
    <h4>
        The Union Depository heist is successful, but Franklin is afterwards approached by Steve and Dave, who contend that Trevor is a liability, and Devin,<br>
        who seeks revenge on Michael. Franklin has three options: kill Trevor, kill Michael, or attempt to save both in a suicide mission. <br>
        Should Franklin choose to kill either Michael or Trevor, his relationship with the other ceases or becomes strained, and he returns to his old life.

    <h4>The trio, aided by Lamar and Lester, withstand an onslaught from the FIB and Merryweather before going on to kill <br>
        Cheng, Stretch, Steve, and Devin. Michael and Trevor reconcile, and the three protagonists cease working together but remain friends.</h4>
